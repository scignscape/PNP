# Publishing for Nonprofits

If you are visiting this repository to examine code I presented at the NISO/JATS conference of 2026, please consult the "presentations" branch.  For other "work in process" look at the "prelim" branch.

**Overview**

The focus of this project is providing free publishing services to nonprofit and/or charitable organizations.  

The project places a special emphasis on technology associated with academic and scientific research.  Although manuscripts with only basic-level requirements are certainly supported, the code shared here might be especially useful to those who seek to develop publications alongside data sets, multimedia presentations, and other supporting materials.

In contemporary academic publishing, the basic unit for sharing experience and ideas often is not a single manuscript, but rather a collection of files packaging variegated content-types, including PDF files for viewing documents, but also machine-readable text encoding, computer code, raw data, and statistical/graphics summaries.  These packages typically adhere to collaborative standards such as Research Object Bundles, Executable Research Objects, FAIR sharing (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), and research-grid specifications for packages deposited on decentralized but searchable community networks.

Why should nonprofits care about Research Objects and science grids, apart from just publishing their own materials?  The answer is that aligning their materials with recognized scientific and academic standards helps nonprofits' work get recognized and incorporated into research ecosystems.  Ideally, pure research institutions and organizations outside of academia -- especially nonprofits -- share a symbiotic relationship.  The concepts of "translational medicine" and "translational science" are increasingly emphasized in contemporary research and focus on how theoretical investigations can be "translated" to social benefits.  All research is motivated in part by potential real-world applications, but the discipline of translational science develops rigorous models and guidelines to help organizations implement socially-conscious protocols, with special attention to community outreach, data management, ongoing assessment, and projects' sustainability.

In the "translational" environment, academic and non-academic institutions are intrinsically linked.  Nonprofits can contribute to these partnerships by systematically warehousing information that could be useful to scientists and other researchers; by examining their day-to-day activities to consider whether there are data or observations that could be incorporated into research projects; by encouraging staff or volunteers to develop studies that could be submitted to technical journals and/or shared with the general public; and by networking with educational institutions in consideration of collaborations, internships, data sharing, and so forth.

Nonprofits focused on public health, education, environmental preservation, community development, and similar areas may find it especially beneficial to develop research collaborations.  But similar ideas apply to many forms of nonprofits and charities.  Concomitant research may be associated with natural/biomedical sciences, humanities, or both.  For instance, groups that work with underprivileged and marginalized communities may have a need for individuals with sociological/social-work training or language and communication experts, who may in turn benefit from experience gained "in the field".  At the same time, the need to maintain health records, intake forms, databases, statistical modules, and user-interface tools can serve to integrate nonprofits into the broader ecosystem of EMR/EHR (Electronic Medical and Health Records) and bioinformatics.  

With that said, traditional publishing -- focused on books and articles -- is of course important to nonprofits as well.  The XXX project will certainly work with organizations whose main emphasis is creating materials to learn about their mission, history, and the everyday stories that make their work worthwhile.  At the same time, XXX continues to develop technology to facilitate both traditional and scientific/data publishing.  Some of this technology is shared or prototyped in the current repository.
