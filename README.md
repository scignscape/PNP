# Publishing for Nonprofits

If you are visiting this repository to examine code I presented at the NISO/JATS conference of 2026, please consult the "presentations" branch.  For other "work in process" look at the "prelim" branch.   

What follows is an informal, thematic overview.  A summary of the included source code is further down this page.

**Overview**

The focus of this project is providing free publishing services to nonprofit and/or charitable organizations.  

The project places a special emphasis on technology associated with academic and scientific research.  Although manuscripts with only basic-level requirements are certainly supported, the code shared here might be especially useful to those who seek to develop publications alongside data sets, multimedia presentations, and other supporting materials.

In contemporary academic publishing, the basic unit for sharing experience and ideas often is not a single manuscript, but rather a collection of files packaging variegated content-types, including PDF files for viewing documents, but also machine-readable text encoding, computer code, raw data, and statistical/graphics summaries.  These packages typically adhere to collaborative standards such as Research Object Bundles, Executable Research Objects, FAIR sharing (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), and research-grid specifications for packages deposited on decentralized but searchable community networks.

The computer code published with this repository can help authors and digital editors create publications that adhere to standards such as FAIRsharing and Executable Research Objects.

**The "diamond" publishing model**

In the genre of open-access publishing, the "diamond" model indicates documents that 
are free for both readers and authors.  This paradigm is usually contrasted with a 
"gold" model where documents are free for readers but require authors to pay 
"processing charges" (APCs).  The diamond model is also sometimes contrasted with a "green" 
model where authors create private copies of articles whose "official" versions are 
behind a paywall.

Another important feature of most diamond systems is that authors retain all copyrights 
to their work.  They are free to share and disseminate their writing however they choose.

In traditional scientific publishing, research data sets and other supplemental 
materials are open-source while the actual books or articles are paywalled as 
commercial products.  One problem with this paradigm is that publications 
cannot be distributed alongside their complementary assets.  This means that 
cross-references between publications and other materials, such as data sets and 
computer code, cannot be rigorously defined.  Also, publications cannot benefit 
from technological integration with associated resources, via techniques 
such as customized PDF viewers specifically designed for a shared data package.

In brief, the diamond model is not only more ethical; it also permits technological 
enhancements that are impossible otherwise.  In ScignPNP all projects are 
assumed to follow the diamond model unless authors specifically choose 
an alternative.

Furthermore, ScignPNP maintains a list of diamond-open-access journals that authors 
can consult if they may wish to submit their writing to a technical journal 
without paywalls, Author Processing Charges, or relinquishing control over their manuscripts.


**Science Grid Technology for Nonprofits**

A science grid increases the visibility of its published projects and also helps them benefit from shared technology.
I believe nonprofits can similarly benefit.  A "nonprofit grid" would help individuals discover nonprofits addressing issues of interest to them, and potentially share computer code and other digital resources.  Creating research-worthy publications informed by nonprofits' mission, experience, and observations is different from a full-fledged research grid, but it's a good start and valuable in its own right.

Aligning with recognized scientific and academic standards helps nonprofits' work get recognized and incorporated into research ecosystems.  Ideally, pure research institutions and organizations outside of academia -- especially nonprofits -- share a symbiotic relationship.  In particulr, the concepts of "translational medicine" and "translational science" are increasingly emphasized in contemporary research and focus on how theoretical investigations can be "translated" to social benefits.  All research is motivated in part by potential real-world applications, but the discipline of translational science develops rigorous models and guidelines to help organizations implement socially-conscious protocols, with special attention to community outreach, data management, ongoing assessment, and projects' sustainability.

In the "translational" environment, academic and non-academic institutions are intrinsically linked.  Nonprofits can contribute to these partnerships by systematically warehousing information that could be useful to scientists and other researchers; by examining their day-to-day activities to consider whether there are data or observations that could be incorporated into research projects; by encouraging staff or volunteers to develop studies that could be submitted to technical journals and/or shared with the general public; and by networking with educational institutions in consideration of collaborations, internships, data sharing, and so forth.

**Use cases**

Nonprofits focused on public health, education, environmental preservation, community development, and similar areas may find it especially beneficial to develop research collaborations.  But similar ideas apply to many forms of nonprofits and charities.  Concomitant research may be associated with natural/biomedical sciences, humanities, or both.  For instance, groups that work with underprivileged and marginalized communities may have a need for individuals with sociological/social-work training or language and communication experts, who may in turn benefit from experience gained "in the field".  At the same time, the need to maintain health records, intake forms, databases, statistical modules, and user-interface tools can serve to integrate nonprofits into the broader ecosystem of EMR/EHR (Electronic Medical and Health Records) and bioinformatics.  

With that said, traditional publishing -- focused on books and articles -- is of course important to nonprofits as well.  The XXX project will certainly work with organizations whose main emphasis is creating materials to learn about their mission, history, and the everyday stories that make their work worthwhile.  At the same time, XXX continues to develop technology to facilitate both traditional and scientific/data publishing.  Some of this technology is shared or prototyped in the current repository.
